                <p id= "definition-par">We are students too, each with our own set of bad experiences that we want to improve on so that others will have a more delightful experience. Education is important to us, one way or another. Almost all of us shifted into our courses because we care about the quality and value of our education above the original incentives offered to us by our previous courses.</p>

            <!-- Needs of the field -->
            <section id = "who">
                <h1>Who did we ask about this?</h1>
                <p class="clickable">James Kamaso, a new AB IS student of Ateneo de Manila University, makes his way into the scene as a freshman. He’s excited to explore all of his interests in the course he applied for, and is ready to learn more content than what his tuition cost. He’s heard many stories about how freeing the college experience is compared to high school, so he packs his bags and get ready for his first day.</p>
                <p class="clickable">His first class is Chemistry, a mandatory core subject. He was put in a group of strangers that will dictate his group assessments and outputs until the end of the semester. James isn’t very knowledgeable about this particular subject. He feels as though it would only add weight onto the academic responsibilities that he has to juggle. In spite of this, he gives the class an honest shot.</p>
                <p class="clickable">His first critique of the collaborative learning experience stems from the class itself. The professor was a researcher who was not a particularly friendly nor approachable educator. She had set serious expectations onto everyone as though her class was the only commitment the students had this semester. She wanted the students to follow what was in the required textbooks, which felt like a better alternative to the learning environment in class. Not only did this exacerbate the disappointment in James’ quality of education, it felt as though the environment itself was actively made to lack features which makes learning exciting.</p>
                <p class="clickable">For the rest of the semester, James tried his best in the subject. His group mates only further contributed to his lack of interest as it felt as though communication was impossible if not discouraged. There was no synergy at all between the members unless they were a part of the internal popular democracy which existed among the blockmates. It was annoying and awful to deal with the way in which personal groups were prioritized over their academic groupings. This reflected itself in the harsh meritocracy of the class (peer evaluations) which only impeded meaningful discourse from manifesting.</p>
                <p class="clickable">While it was not directly the fault of the professor, James felt as though it was the responsibility of the facilitator to provide the missing bridge of effective communication which was sorely needed in the class. If only there were ways to improve the collaborative learning experience for James! The current system is outdated and saturated, it fails to effectively deliver a meaningful and personal experience.</p>
                <p class="clickable">In the end, James learned more about the topic through research and alternative forms of education. It was individualized and outside of his class. He tried to find ways to put enough effort into it, as all he cared for was passing it and getting a decent grade. The entire project was taxing not only on him but everyone else, and the final output was barely acceptable. In the end, James had an awful experience and he grew to have a distaste for collaborative learning.</p>
